# Hiatus

After SCOTUS overturned Roe v. Wade last month, we knew anit-choice people with power would try to obscure where people can access safe and legal healthcare; we wanted to build Hiatus on web3 to ensure anyone can access information on abortion services, regardless of where they live. Hiatus is at the beginning stages of a MVP, and we will continue to expand and impove its data and features.

## Technologies Used
- Frontend: React.js, Bootstrap, Axios
- Backend: Mongoose, MongoDB, Express.js, PassportJWT
- APIs: Google Maps, Abortion Policy
- Hosting Site: Fleek.co

## Website Premise
- Users can access abortion policies organized by state.
- Users can find abortion clinic and services data according to state. 
- Users are able to find organizations they can donate to in the Donate section found in the footer. 

## What's Next?
- We'd love to partner with Planned Parenthood, the National Network of Abotion Funds, the Center for Reproductive Rights, and Abortionfinder.org
- Work on improving the site's security to ensure we secure routes, data, and our overall website.
- Implement a login feature that is safe, and does not collect user data to ensure privacy.
- Implement a review and story feature so that people can leave reviews of the clinics and share their stoties in a safe way. We want to make sure our site is cyberbullying-free.
- Collecting up-to-date data on clinics from all 50 states post-Roe.
- Collecting up-to-date data on aborion policies from all 50 states to create our own API.
- Making Hiatus mobile-friendly with @media-quieries.
- Create a React Component for the Map.

## Known Bugs
- Once a user clicks on the "Read More" in the Stories' section, it only contracts when the user clicks on another story. 
- The NavBar only works on the landing page. Once the user goes into the State and Clinic page, the NavBar doesn't lead back to the landing page.
- The Map component sometimes does not rerender backloads, and it has problems parsing from html to react.
